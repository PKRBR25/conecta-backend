## Completed Tasks
1. Project initialization (2025-05-11)
   - Created Git repository
   - Added README.md
   - Added PLANNING.md
   - Added .gitignore
   - Added TASK.md

2. Authentication System (2025-05-11)
   - Implemented user registration
   - Added JWT authentication
   - Created password recovery system with email verification
   - Added rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Set up email integration with Gmail SMTP
   - Added bilingual support (EN/PT-BR)

3. Testing (2025-05-13)
   - Implemented rate limiting tests for all authentication endpoints
   - Verified correct limits: 5/min for login/register, 3/min for password recovery
   - Added proper mocking for database interactions
   - Ensured test isolation using pytest fixtures

## Today's Progress (2025-05-13)
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Added code quality checks (Black, Flake8, MyPy)
- Added test coverage reporting
- Configured Railway deployment stages
- Fixed code formatting with Black locally
- Updated dependencies and configurations

## Next Steps
1. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Fix remaining Black formatting issues in CI
   - Verify test environment variables are correctly set
   - Test staging deployment
   - Test production deployment

2. Environment Setup
   - Choose between virtualenv, Docker, or fixing Python permissions
   - Set up consistent development environment
   - Document environment setup process

3. Testing
   - Verify all tests pass in CI environment
   - Add more test coverage if needed
   - Document test setup and requirements

## Discovered During Work
- Email configuration requires careful setup:
  - Use SSL on port 465 for Gmail SMTP
  - App-specific password required for Gmail
  - Proper error handling for email sending is crucial

- Testing best practices:
  - Use MagicMock for database interactions
  - Add small delays between rate-limited requests
  - Test both success and error scenarios
  - Mock dependencies to ensure test isolation
